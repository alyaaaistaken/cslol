Write the first draft of the Word Script that accompanies the slides. The script should be detailed enough to be used for recording.

Logging & System Focus:
Start the Project Log and Personal Logs immediately.** Make a daily entry habit. After each work session, take 5 minutes to note what you accomplished, add a screenshot of the result, and write a brief lesson learned.
